In recent years, there has been an increase in research and design of peptides. 
In this work, we propose peptide design with specific activities, based only on 
the type and order of amino acids in a peptide. We use a neural network to learn 
the fitness function which is later used in a genetic algorithm, to create peptides. 
Our approach shows promising results, as we succeed in creating peptides with high accuracy.
